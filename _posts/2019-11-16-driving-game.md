My second year project, during my undergrad studies, consisted in developping a driving robot simulator. We had to make a map editor with a variety of obstacles. The robot also had to have a self-driving mode where it could follow a black line created by a user in the editor. I implemented the sound module with the help of FMOD. I also worked on the UI, mainly on the user settings. Futhermore, I worked on the save system for the maps. Finally, I also helped developping the map editor with features like zooming and resizing the window.
