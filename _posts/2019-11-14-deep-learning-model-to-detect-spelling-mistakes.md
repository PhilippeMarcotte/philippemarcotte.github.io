This project convert the [model made by mkroutikov](https://github.com/mkroutikov/tf-lstm-char-cnn), which was used to predict english words, in order to detect spelling mistakes. The words are converted to an embedding using chatacter-embedding. Then, the embeddings go through a convolutionnal layer and an LSTM.
