For my third project class during my undergrad studies, we had to port a driving game, made during the second year, to iPad and add a networking component. The latter entailed being able to edit map a la Google Doc and having multiple players driving on it at the same time. The iPad application also had to work online. I lead the team that worked on the iPad application. We had to remake the whole game in a new environment. I also implemented an instant messaging system for the iOS application.
